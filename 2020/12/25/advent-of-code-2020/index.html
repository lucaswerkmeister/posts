      <p>
        This year I participated in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> for the first time.
        (Thanks a lot to my colleague <a href="https://www.lebenplusplus.de/">Gabriel Birke</a> for the suggestion!)
        I wrote a README.md file for each day’s puzzle – effectively one blog post per day – but I thought I’d write some summarizing thoughts here as well.
        You can find those READMEs along with my solutions at <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020">lucas&shy;werkmeister<wbr>/advent-of-code-2020</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, and I’m glad I did it.
        Some of the puzzles were a bit tedious, but most were fun and enjoyable.
        And while a handful of my solutions are inefficient or brute force,
        most of the time I managed to a reasonably efficient way to solve the puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I solved the puzzles in a variety of programming languages,
        depending on what I thought would be a good fit,
        or what I wanted to gain some experience with,
        or just whatever I felt like at the time.
        The GitHub breakdown shows that the repository is 82% Rust,
        but that’s in part because the Rust solutions tend to be longer
        (due to having more error handling, tests etc.);
        here’s the breakdown by day / puzzle:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Rust</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>12</strong> of my solutions were Rust programs.
          I used Rust more frequently for the later puzzles;
          it was especially my choice of language for anything that needed performance or more complicated algorithms.
          I haven’t had that much experience with Rust yet,
          and I enjoyed getting to know it better;
          I feel like I’m starting to understand ownership and borrowing now.
        </dd>
        <dt>Bash</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>7</strong> of my solutions were shell scripts.
          I like shell scripts:
          they let you quickly iterate on a solution,
          trying things out on the command line before writing them into the script.
          Shell scripts can also combine different tools;
          for instance, for one solution (<a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/day07">day 7</a>),
          I used a fairly obscure GNU coreutils command, <code>tsort</code>,
          to perform a <em>topological sort</em> of the input.
          (<strong>1</strong> more solution, <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/day15">day 15</a>,
          started out as a shell script but was then rewritten in JavaScript.)
        </dd>
        <dt>AWK</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>3</strong> of my solutions were AWK scripts
          (some specific to GNU AWK, some should work with any POSIX-compliant AWK as far as I’m aware, though I only used GNU AWK),
          plus <strong>1</strong> more if you count <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/day10">day 10</a>,
          which is a shell script but mostly uses AWK.
          I like AWK as well – the pattern of running commands for each input line,
          and then summarizing them in an <code>END</code> or <code>ENDFILE</code> action,
          worked pretty well for some puzzles.
        </dd>
        <dt>sed</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>1</strong> of my solutions was a sed program,
          though some of my other shell scripts used sed as well, of course.
          I did this one mainly to prove that it could be done,
          and that I could use more of sed than just the <code>s</code> command –
          this was my first time using the “hold space” in a sed program I wrote from scratch, I think.
        </dd>
        <dt>R</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>1</strong> of my solutions was an R program,
          since I thought its numerical capacities would be a good fit for <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/day12">day 12</a>.
          It was nice enough, and I also happened to uncover <a href="https://github.com/oracle/fastr/issues/171">a FastR bug</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>1</strong> of my solutions was written in JavaScript.
          Initially I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/day15">day 15 solution</a> in Bash,
          but part 2 was pretty much the same puzzle as part 1 except with a much higher limit,
          so that my Bash solution would not be fast enough to finish in any reasonable amount of time.
          JavaScript was the language where I thought it would be fairly straightforward to rewrite/translate my solution line-by-line –
          I trusted V8’s engine to optimize the code enough,
          and while it still took a while, it was good enough for me.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I’ll probably do Advent of Code next year again in some form.
        Maybe then I’ll use Rust every day –
        that would let me use <a href="https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc">cargo-aoc</a>,
        which looked useful but didn’t really fit with this year’s repository layout
        of having one top-level <code>day<var>XY</var></code> directory per day.
