        I hereby declare partial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy">email bankruptcy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to an unfortunate accident on my mail server,
        I have lost track of all my unread emails
        (if I still have them, they’re marked as read now),
        and I have probably also completely lost an unknown amount of emails in my inbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were waiting for anything from me,
        please let me know and I’ll try to pick it up again.
        (Although you are very much welcome, in fact encouraged,
        to wait a bit before doing so!
        I’m not going to be able to immediately react to
        everything that was waiting for a response from me.)
        This is not strictly limited to things you directly sent to me via email,
        as some of the unread emails were probably notifications from various other platforms.
      </p>
