        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>,
        the software behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>
        and <a href="https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Main_Page">many other wikis</a>,
        allows visitors to copy a ‚Äúpermanent link‚Äù (or ‚Äúpermalink‚Äù) of the article they are currently viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Permanent_link">English Wikipedia‚Äôs help page on permanent links</a> notes,
        these links aren‚Äôt fully ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù:
        visiting these links later is not guaranteed to show the exact same content.
        I thought it would be useful to list some of the different ways in which differences can appear.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Please note that I‚Äôm mainly focusing on Wikimedia wikis here,
          and for examples will often refer to Wikipedias in particular;
          many of these issues will also affect other MediaWiki sites,
          but there are probably additional ways in which third-party wikis can have permalinks‚Äô contents change
          (e.g. Fandom / Wikia has tons of custom extensions),
          and I‚Äôm generally not super interested in those.
          (But if I forgot something relevant to Wikimedia or standard MediaWiki,
          let me know and I might edit it in.)
        </p>
      </aside>
      <h2>What a permalink is</h2>
      <p>
        While the permalink shown in the sidebar (or ‚Äútools‚Äù menu) contains both the <code>title=</code> and <code>oldid=</code> URL parameters
        (example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_Commons&oldid=1185477778">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_Commons&amp;oldid=1185477778</a>),
        only the <code>oldid=</code> is actually required
        (equivalent example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1185477778">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1185477778</a>).
        The value of this parameter is the revision ID of a page,
        and it tells MediaWiki to use the content of this revision of that page instead of its latest revision.
        For normal wiki articles, this content is the wikitext (the source code of the article),
        which is then rendered and shown to the visitor;
        you can also see the content unrendered by adding <code>&action=raw</code> to the URL
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1185477778&action=raw">example</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in on-wiki content</h2>
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs start with the biggest one.
        Visiting a permalink only loads the content of the page itself as of the revision specified in the URL.
        Any other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template">templates</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua">Lua/Scribunto modules</a>,
        or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Transclusion">other transcluded pages</a>
        are loaded, parsed / evaluated and shown using their latest revision,
        not whatever was their latest revision when the permalink‚Äôs revision was created.
        Templates may look and behave very differently from what they used to do;
        their parameters also may or may not be compatible with the template invocation in the old revision,
        depending on how the community edited the templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, it‚Äôs not even guaranteed that the page will show the same templates at all.
        Templates are looked up by their name according to the old revision‚Äôs wikitext,
        but templates can be deleted, recreated, or renamed.
        For instance, several wikis now have templates like <code>{{Q|Q123}}</code> and/or <code>{{P|P123}}</code>
        to show Wikidata items and/or properties;
        but in the past, ‚Äú<code>Q</code>‚Äù or ‚Äú<code>P</code>‚Äù may have referred to different templates that were later deleted,
        as e.g. on <a href="https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialaƒµo:Protokolo?page=≈úablono%3AP">Esperanto</a>,
        <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97?page=Template%3AP">Chinese</a> or
        <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Especial:Registro?page=Plantilla%3AQ">Spanish</a> Wikipedia.
        (These are conveniently short names, after all!
        On English Wikipedia, <code>{{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:P">P</a>}}</code> is still a smiley üôÇ)
      </p>
      <p>
        A more niche phenomenon is redlinks (h/t <a href="https://mamot.fr/@pintoch/112953410745774438">Antonin Delpeuch</a> for this one).
        MediaWiki shows internal links to existing pages in blue, and links to pages that don‚Äôt exist in red;
        but when rendering a permalink, this refers to whether the page currently exists,
        not whether it used to exist when the old revision was saved.
        (You can actually see this in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1185477778">example permalink from earlier</a>,
        where a ‚Äúnot to be confused with‚Äù <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hatnote">hatnote</a> points to a redlink that was evidently deleted in the meantime.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Articles may also be affected by changes in the wiki‚Äôs default interface <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Common.js_and_common.css">JavaScript and CSS</a>
        and default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Gadget">gadgets</a>,
        which may interact with page contents.
        For example, styles for frequently used templates are sometimes moved into <code>common.css</code> (or out of it),
        and some templates may rely on gadgets for interactive functionality
        (like ‚Äì CW for some medical imagery in the next link ‚Äì Wikimedia Commons‚Äô <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Imagestack">Imagestack</a>).
        As with templates, it‚Äôs ultimately up to the community whether changes here are backwards compatible or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in content on other wikis</h2>
      <p>
        Articles can also use content from other wikis,
        the most prominent example being Wikimedia Commons images
        (which, thanks to <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/InstantCommons">InstantCommons</a>,
        are used not only on Wikimedia wikis but also <em>many</em> other wikis using MediaWiki).
        A permalink will show the latest version of an image on Commons,
        which is not necessarily the same version as was shown when the old revision was saved ‚Äì
        although, due to Commons‚Äô <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Don%27t_be_bold&rdfrom=commons:Commons:Be_bold">don‚Äôt be bold</a> policy,
        the differences should usually be minor
        (e.g. a higher-quality version or a slightly improved crop).
      </p>
      <p>
        The image on Commons may also have been deleted in the meantime,
        e.g. because it turned out to be a copyright violation.
        In this case, the permalink will show the image as a redlink.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also other ways for wikis to refer to Commons.
        Prior to its <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T334940">undeployment due to security issues</a>,
        the Graph extension could load data from the Data: namespace on Commons,
        and show it e.g. as a line chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then there‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata">Wikidata</a>.
        Wikipedia editors can, at their discretion, make an article read information from Wikidata;
        this has a number of benefits,
        but is also another case where visible parts of an article aren‚Äôt part of the article‚Äôs source code
        and viewing old revisions will still pull the latest version from the referenced place.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in the software</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, the software which actually renders the old revision‚Äôs content is also subject to changes.
        MediaWiki sees roughly two thousand code changes per release, <!-- git log --oneline --grep='Update git submodules\|Localisation updates\|^Merge' --invert-grep gerrit/REL1_41..gerrit/REL1_42 | wc -l # repeat for a few older REL branch pairs -->
        and any of them might affect the way an article looks.
        While the parser is developed fairly conservatively
        (as nobody wants to break millions of existing pages all at once),
        there are sometimes breaking changes to it;
        many of them may be preceded by on-wiki fixes to avoid the breakage
        (e.g. using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Linter">Linter</a> to locate problematic constructs whose behavior will change in future),
        but this doesn‚Äôt help when looking at old revisions.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          (Side note: Because the parser always produces <em>some</em> output HTML,
          and never returns an error like ‚Äúinvalid input wikitext‚Äù,
          arguably any change to its output is a breaking change.
          After all, even if some new wikitext syntax is intentionally introduced,
          that syntax will previously have rendered in a different way,
          and it‚Äôs theoretically possible that someone used that syntax and relies on its previous behavior.
          This is also something that irritates me about Markdown ‚Äúflavors‚Äù
          that describe themselves as ‚Äúcompatible with‚Äù or ‚Äústrict supersets of‚Äù CommonMark.)
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        Also, similar to the earlier point about the wiki‚Äôs default CSS and JS,
        the old revision may also have relied on CSS or JS included in MediaWiki, which is subject to change.
        For example, many articles rely on <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Collapsible_elements">collapsible elements</a>
        (which is an intentional feature offered by MediaWiki which has stayed very stable so far),
        and many pages (help and project pages more so than articles, I believe)
        rely or relied on styles from the OOUI or MediaWiki UI interface libraries,
        a practice that is <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T360010">increasingly discouraged</a>
        as these libraries are being phased out in favor of Codex
        (though <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T355242">the replacement is not yet clear</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>Now what?</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to create a new link to some wiki content as you currently see it:
        you can use a permalink as offered by MediaWiki (it‚Äôs a pretty ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù solution),
        but if you want to be absolutely sure that everyone else will see the same content,
        I believe the only way to do that and avoid all the issues here
        is to grab a snapshot of the <em>rendered</em> wiki content and distribute that.
        You can do this via a trusted intermediary,
        such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine">Wayback Machine</a>,
        or you can save the page yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you‚Äôre looking at a permalink that you found somewhere else,
        I think it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that there are some caveats to it,
        but 99% of the time it‚Äôs fine ‚Äì
        in practice, I think most of the issues listed here are more theoretical than practical concerns.
        If you really want to be sure you‚Äôre seeing a page as it originally appeared,
        you can try to find a snapshot on the Wayback Machine or another web archiving site.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a proposal for a <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Ainali/Wiki_Timeslicer">Wiki Timeslicer</a> tool which would bypass some of these problems.
        (Personally, I‚Äôm skeptical how feasible it is, to be honest.
        But it probably is possible to improve on MediaWiki‚Äôs own functionality, at least.)
