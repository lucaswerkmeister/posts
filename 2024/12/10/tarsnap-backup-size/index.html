      <p>
        <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> is an encrypted backup product.
        The client software is gratis and source-available (but not FLOSS);
        you pay for storage (US$ 0.25 / GB-month) and network traffic (US$ 0.25 / GB) on and with their service.
        You get an email notification when your current account balance dips below 7 days’ worth of storage costs at your current size,
        at which point you should increase your balance and/or delete some old backups.
        (There’s no built-in auto-deletion of backups;
        some third-party software exists but I just do it manually.)
        My backups include <code>/etc</code> and <code>/home</code>,
        with an exclude list of various files and directories that I don’t need backed up
        which I put together when I first set up these backups.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I most recently got this notification,
        I was disturbed to see that the daily storage costs were higher than usual –
        not exorbitant but bad enough to warrant inspection.
        I could see in the account history on which day the storage cost had increased,
        but I didn’t remember what happened on that day which might have triggered it.
        I set out to extract the most recent backup so I could inspect it with <code>ncdu</code> –
        this seemed like the most practical way to find out what was taking up the most space inside.
        The extraction process took much longer than I expected
        (as of this writing, it’s been running for 10 days and hasn’t actually finished yet),
        but partway through it became clear that I had inadvertently included a large SQL dump in the backup,
        and failed to update the exclude list when renaming some previously-excluded ISO files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because waiting for days to extract the latest backup doesn’t sound like a great experience to go through regularly
        (and remember, you’re paying for that network traffic to download it again!),
        I started thinking about alternative solutions to find out what’s getting backed up.
        I found out that <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncdu">ncdu</a></code> (“ncurses disk usage”) has an option to exclude files from the disk usage report,
        and its pattern syntax is (as far as I can tell) compatible with the one for Tarsnap.
        So I put together a little shell script to run <code>ncdu</code> with the exclude list from my Tarsnap config;
        you can find the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/main/.bashrc.d/ncdu-tarsnap">latest version</a> on GitHub (assuming I don’t rename the file),
        or the current version as of this writing below:

        Looking through the data-that-would-be-backed-up in <code>ncdu-tarsnap</code>,
        I was able to identify several patterns that I should add to my exclude list,
        and also some data that I could also just delete from my live file system.
        So that’s the first part of my One Weird Trick (so sorry about that title):
        <strong>adjust your exclude patterns based on your current file system contents.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s all nice and well, but what happens the next time I leave a large SQL dump in my home directory without thinking about the backups?
        I realized I needed to set up a process to periodically check the total size of the data-that-would-be-backed-up and alert me if it got too large.
        <code>ncdu</code> isn’t useful for that,
        but fortunately <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_(Unix)">du</a></code> (“disk usage”) also has exclude-pattern support,
        again with compatible syntax,
        and is easy to use in a shell script.
        Sending a desktop notification from a systemd system service
        (I need it to run with privileges because not all the files in my home directory are readable by me)
        isn’t pretty, but the following works:

        (Of course, you may want to adjust the hard-coded threshold to something other than 50 GB.
        And maybe you prefer another notification setup as well.)
        The timer is set up to run hourly, whereas my backups run weekly,
        so that should give me enough time to act whenever it notifies me.
        (I included a pointer to <code>ncdu-tarsnap</code> in the notification text in case I forget what I called the script.)
        And that’s the second part of my One Weird Trick:
        <strong>Set up alerts if your projected backup size exceeds a preconfigured limit.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Either of these could be built into Tarsnap,
        but as far as I can tell, they aren’t.
        But at least it’s not too difficult to build them around Tarsnap instead.
        (The above scripts and units might even be applicable to other backup solutions,
        as long as those solutions also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">glob/fnmatch</a>-like patterns.)
