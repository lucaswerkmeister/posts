        Quick blog post to recap Chaos Communication Camp 2023,
        so I have something to remember later,
        beyond my <a href="https://wikis.world/@LucasWerkmeister/tagged/CCCamp23">#CCCamp23 posts on Wikis World (Mastodon)</a>
        and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListFiles&dir=prev&offset=20230722192641%7CCSD_Berlin_2023_-_Lucas_Werkmeister_-_42.jpg&limit=4&user=Lucas+Werkmeister">few photos on Wikimedia Commons</a>.
        This won‚Äôt be very structured, but hopefully it‚Äôs better than nothing :)
      </p>
      <h2>General camp experience</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, I had a quite relaxed time at camp.
        I sat around, talked to some people, enjoyed myself.
        I didn‚Äôt do as many ‚Äúactivities‚Äù as many others
        (and in particular, I didn‚Äôt stay up late at all, actually going to bed earlier than I normally do :D),
        and I‚Äôm fine with that. üòå
      </p>
      <p>
        Last camp, I think I didn‚Äôt attend any talks at all,
        never even entering the big talk tents.
        This year, I attended a few
        (I think it helped that they spread out the talks and didn‚Äôt have the central tents anymore ‚Äì
        this meant smaller crowds and more open air, both of which was good for covid reasons),
        mostly as an angel (video mixing, camera, or translation).
        I enjoyed angeling and would like to do it again.
        The sessions I watched without angeling were

        <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cbase-207-never-mind-the-gig-wo">the coffeebots</a>,
        and <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57534-hacken_dass">Hacken, dass‚Ä¶?</a>,
        all of which were cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        My only real ‚Äúproject‚Äù at camp was writing the m3api 1.0.0 release announcement blog post.
        (This is actually the biggest blocker left for the 1.0.0 release, I think.)
        I made good progress there; stay tuned on this blog ^^
      </p>
      <p>
        I also went to the nearby lakes about once per day on average,
        and would fully recommend that.
        (Although, if you‚Äôre not there by bike, your range is going to be a bit more limited.
        But some are still reachable.)
      </p>
      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>
        I went to the Ziegeleipark Mildenberg and back by bike;
        my tent, sleeping bag and sleeping mat were transported with the rest of the WMDE stuff,
        so I only carried the rest of my stuff (clothes, laptop, etc.) by bike.
        Having the bike at camp was definitely useful and I‚Äôd like to have it again next time.
        If I want to carry <em>everything</em> by bike,
        I‚Äôll need to look into some additional options to attach things to it,
        and might also want to look into a lighter sleeping bag
        (my current one was also rather warm anyways).
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote Mastodon threads on the <a href="https://wikis.world/@LucasWerkmeister/110880932061768998">way there</a>
        and <a href="https://wikis.world/@LucasWerkmeister/110926414608353250">back again</a>,
        though it wasn‚Äôt as many posts as during <a href="https://nitter.net/LucasWerkmeistr/status/1164116092882739200">the way to CCCamp17</a> four years ago.
      </p>
      <h2>DECT</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first chaos event where I brought a DECT phone.
        I didn‚Äôt use it very much, but it was still useful a few times,
        and I‚Äôm planning to bring it to future chaos events too (since I bought it anyways ^^).
      </p>
      <p>
        I left the phone‚Äôs base station at home,
        instead bringing a rechargeable battery charger,
        so I could charge the phone‚Äôs AAA batteries as well as others
        (some other things I brought also had AAA).
        In the end, I didn‚Äôt end up charging anything else using that charger, so it was a wash.
        (Curiously enough, although several other people brought other phone models from the same company,
        my phone wasn‚Äôt able to charge from any of their base stations as far as I could tell.
        I don‚Äôt know if Gigaset do anything weird with their phones where each model charges slightly differently and incompatibly or what.)
      </p>
      <h2>Packing / Inventory</h2>
      <p>
        A few months before camp, I started a google doc to list things I might want to bring.
        I eventually turned this into a comprehensive list of <em>all</em> the things I brought
        (and some that I couldn‚Äôt fit after all, such as my bl√•haj üòî),
        and where I marked things that I had packed already.
        Later, during and after camp, I added notes to my future self
        about which things turned out to be useful and which things I should change or leave home next time.
        I think this mode works pretty well for me (I‚Äôve used it for a few other things too),
        and I look forward to going over this list in four years ^^
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things I brought that turned out to be quite useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a rubber mallet for tent pegs (apparently I was the only one in our village to bring one, and it was quite popular)</li>
        <li>insect spray (did its job)</li>
        <li>work gloves (very useful for buildup, teardown, and the occasional angel shift)</li>
        <li>small packages of shower gel, shampoo and toothpaste (i.e. instead of full-size ones)</li>
        <li>earplugs (very useful at night)</li>
        <li>nail polish (I liked having it and one other person also used it)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And some things that I needn‚Äôt have brought after all, or otherwise have some qualifying notes for next time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I brought two lamps, and two power banks, but only used one of each, and that only during the last teardown night on Sunday
          (i.e. depending on whether I plan to stay that long again or not, I could even skip them completely)
        </li>
        <li>I brought too many warm clothes (<em>some</em> are good to have but I brought too many)</li>
        <li>I brought too much food for the way there and back (this is a general problem I have on bike tours)</li>
        <li>I didn‚Äôt use my swimming trunks (naturism is common in eastern Germany, and while I didn‚Äôt grow up with it, I now found it rather more convenient)</li>
        <li>the previous camp‚Äôs badge also sat unused in my backpack the whole time</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt have one, I just didn‚Äôt want to end the blog post on a bulleted list that doesn‚Äôt even end with a full stop.
        Looking forward to the next Chaos Communication Camp in four years!
