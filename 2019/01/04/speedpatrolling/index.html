        At <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60178200">35C3</a>, I held a one-hour presentation
        (<a href="https://cfp.verschwoerhaus.de/35c3/talk/XRQNHR/">talk page</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:35c3_WikipakaWG_-_Building_a_Wikidata_tool_(eng).webm">recording</a>)
        where I built a simple Wikidata tool from scratch and deployed it on Wikimedia Toolforge.
        To avoid giving the impression that I can just churn out tools like it’s no big deal,
        this blog post describes how I practiced the presentation
        and which problems I encountered at the time
        (so that I wouldn’t have to encounter them live during the presentation),
        as well as the problems that still occurred during the presentation despite my practice.
      </p>
      <aside>
        The tool isn’t really in a finished state yet –
        as of this writing, I have to clean it up some more before properly announcing it –
        but you can already try it out at <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/speedpatrolling/">tools.wmflabs.org/speedpatrolling</a> if you want.
      </aside>
      <h2>Basic idea</h2>
      <p>
        The general idea for this tool was suggested by <a href="https://twitter.com/Jokrates">Jonas</a> during some conversations a while ago:
        while <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T95878">Wikidata’s mobile interface currently doesn’t let you edit</a>,
        and fixing that will probably be a lot of work,
        one way for people to contribute while mobile,
        e. g. on the train to work or in similar situations,
        would be a kind of “patrolling <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:GoToLinkedPage/enwiki/Q15078152">Tinder</a>” –
        swipe right to mark an edit as patrolled,
        swipe left to undo it or roll it back,
        or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I don’t have any experience working with touch devices or gesture inputs,
        I decided to go with three simple buttons for the first version:
        skip an edit (very important – never force users to make a contribution just to move forward when they might not understand the current task!),
        mark as patrolled,
        or rollback.
        People without rollback rights would simply not have the option to rollback –
        undoing one edit is not very helpful,
        since vandalism often happens in series of edits,
        and I didn’t want to reimplement rollback functionality for people without proper rollback rights.
        (Also, I couldn’t use “Tinder” in the name, so it was unimaginatively to be called “SpeedPatrolling”.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also asked <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Lydia_Pintscher_(WMDE)">Lydia</a> if she was okay with this idea
        (all this was going to be a private activity, but still,
        I don’t want to do things that she thinks are a bad idea,
        probably for good reasons that I can’t think of).
        We looked through the <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90870">list of self-contained tasks around Wikidata</a> for something else to do,
        but couldn’t find much that fit the bill of this presentation
        (Toolforge tool, uses OAuth, can be built in one hour),
        so she said I could go ahead with this project.
      </p>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        Lots of things changed during the preparation phase.
        I didn’t keep track of all of them,
        so the following list, recalled from memory, is likely incomplete.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The first problem arrived as soon as I tried to start working on the tool.
            I was going to use the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/cookiecutter-toolforge">cookiecutter-toolforge</a> template to get started with the tool,
            which includes a hook to check that the tool name you provided is actually a legal tool name.
            The hook was originally only compatible with Python 3;
            however, I was going to hold this presentation on my work laptop, which has Ubuntu installed,
            where Cookiecutter is only available for Python 2.
            In order to be able to use the template, I first needed to <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/cookiecutter-toolforge/commit/62429fb8c50fb8c889495cb13a47b378cbbd1a5a">update the hook to support Python 2</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When I originally planned the outline of the code I was going to write
            (before I even started actually writing any code),
            I intended to get at least as far as the “diff” page,
            including the buttons to skip, patrol or rollback an edit,
            before getting started with OAuth.
            However, as soon as I actually started programming the tool
            (first step: get a list of unpatrolled recent changes),
            I noticed that this didn’t work:
            the information whether an edit is patrolled or not isn’t public,
            so to even get a list of unpatrolled changes
            you need to make an API request as a user with the <code>patrol</code> right.
            This meant that I had to move the registration of the OAuth consumer to the very beginning of the presentation,
            just after the introductory remarks and the tool template setup,
            before I could even start to write a single line of code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then, when figuring out how to get a list of unpatrolled changes via the API,
            I found that the values for the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Brecentchanges"><code>rcshow</code> parameter</a> were insufficiently documented;
            specifically, I was unsure whether I needed <code>!patrolled</code> or <code>unpatrolled</code> changes,
            and the difference between them wasn’t documented anywhere
            (<code>unpatrolled</code> was <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/2985437#Parameters">completely missing</a>).
            To understand the relationship between patrolled, autopatrolled and unpatrolled edits,
            I first had to look through the MediaWiki code
            and then tried to <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Diff/3013350">update the documentation</a> to the best of my ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            While looking at the code,
            I also found a (very minor) security bug,
            which I reported as <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T212118">T212118</a>.
            It hasn’t been fixed yet (and as such is not yet publicly visible),
            but should hopefully be resolved soon.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When writing the handler for the <code>/diff/</code> route,
            I originally intended to have it redirect to <code>/diff/<var>id</var>/</code>,
            without implementing that route
            (so the browser would display a 404 page after handling the redirect).
            However, Flask’s <code>url_for()</code> function requires a function name,
            so to implement the redirect,
            a stub <code>/diff/<var>id</var>/</code> is also necessary.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              I also briefly struggled to find good names for these functions,
              since they can’t very well both be called <code>diff()</code>,
              even though that’s the only constant part in both routes.
              In the end I settled on <code>any_diff()</code> and <code>diff()</code>.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li id="embed">
          <p>
            My original plan for the “diff” page was to directly embed the mobile diff page,
            since it’s a nicely compact representation of the diff, with not too much clutter on the page
            (no sidebar, header bar, etc., which would look weird when embedded on another page).
            However, during the first practice round, I discovered that MediaWiki would not let me do that:
            since I was logged in, and the diff page included a “mark as patrolled” link,
            MediaWiki sent an <code>X-Frame-Options: deny</code> header to prevent <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:GoToLinkedPage/enwiki/Q163231">clickjacking</a>,
            so the browser only displayed a blank iframe on the tool page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to make embedding the diff page work –
            for example, if I could somehow instruct the iframe to load anonymously,
            as in a private window (that is, without cookie headers),
            so that the user would not be logged in and MediaWiki would not prevent the embedding –
            but ultimately found no working solution for that.
            Instead, I decided to download the diff page from the tool’s code (anonymously),
            serve it under a certain route,
            and then embed that page (from my own tool) in the tool’s full diff page.
            This was implemented using the following Python code:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-python">@app.route('/diff/&lt;int:id&gt;/embed')
def diff_embed(id):
    with urllib.request.urlopen('https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/%d' % id) as r:
        html = r.read().decode('utf-8')
    html = html.replace('"/w/', '"https://m.wikidata.org/w/')
    html = html.replace('"/wiki/', '"https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/')
    return html
</code></pre>
          <p>
            The two <code>replace()</code> calls try to turn some relative URLs into absolute ones,
            e. g. in hyperlinks or when loading JavaScript/CSS.
            It’s a hack, of course, but it more or less worked and would be good enough for the presentation.
            (A proper version of this would presumably better be implemented using the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:GoToLinkedPage/enwiki/Q2893296">Beautiful Soup</a> library.)
            In the second practice run, I didn’t even bother embedding Wikidata and went straight for this hack instead;
            however, I afterwards decided that it would be nicer for the presentation to first show the error when embedding Wikidata,
            and then introduce the hack,
            since it looked like there would be enough time for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            To my great surprise, though, during the presentation embedding Wikidata suddenly worked, with no error.
            I only later figured out what happened:
            in the first practice run, I planned to first embed <code>https://<strong>www</strong>.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/<var>id</var></code>,
            and then briefly mention how the mobile diff page on the main domain still has some clutter on it,
            and that we need to use the mobile domain instead, embedding <code>https://<strong>m</strong>.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/<var>id</var></code>.
            As I then ran into the <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header, I never got as far as the <code>m.wikidata.org</code> domain.
            However, during the presentation, I skipped the <code>www.wikidata.org</code> step and went straight to <code>m.wikidata.org</code>,
            and since I’m not logged in there,
            there’s no “mark as patrolled” link and MediaWiki lets me embed this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I can’t rely on the fact that all tool users would never be logged in on <code>m.wikidata.org</code>
            (this tool is, in fact, meant to be especially useful on mobile),
            so I’ll still have to work around this somehow;
            however, in the meantime, I also learned that the <a href="https://labels.wmflabs.org/">Wiki Labels tool</a>
            (<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/wikilabels">source code</a>)
            also includes pretty diffs in its output, without embedding anything,
            so I’ll look into how that is implemented instead of resurrecting my ugly hack.
            (Fortunately, Wiki Labels is also a Flask app and published under a permissive source code license,
            so it should be possible to borrow the relevant code from it.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When I first started adding buttons to the diff page,
            I discovered that clicking the “skip” button
            unexpectedly sent a POST request to <code>/diff/skip</code> instead of <code>/diff/<var>id</var>/skip</code>.
            I eventually figured out that this was
            because had written the “diff” route as <code>/diff/<var>id</var></code> instead of <code>/diff/<var>id</var><strong>/</strong></code>;
            without the trailing slash, the relative URL in <code>formaction="skip"</code> replaced the last URL component instead of appending to it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The cookiecutter-toolforge template includes some sample code for protection against
            <abbr title="cross-site request forgery"><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:GoToLinkedPage/enwiki/Q15401472">CSRF</a></abbr> attacks,
            which I had recently strengthened after discovering that the original version was not completely effective.
            However, I hadn’t tested this strengthened version properly,
            and as a result all POSTs were rejected as invalid until I fixed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, the CSRF protection included the following code (abbreviated):
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-python">def full_url(endpoint, **kwargs):
    schema=flask.request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto', 'http')
    return flask.url_for(endpoint, _external=True, _schema=schema, **kwargs)

def submitted_request_valid():
    # ...
    if not flask.request.referrer.startswith(full_url('index')):
        return False
    return True</code></pre>
          <p>
            This was intended to check that the referrer started with <code>https://tools.wmflabs.org/<var>tool-name</var>/</code>;
            the HTTP/HTTPS tweaking in <code>full_url()</code> is necessary because Flask on Toolforge sits behind a proxy,
            and so it doesn’t know that absolute URLs to it should actually use HTTPS, not HTTP.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the parameter to communicate this to <code>flask.url_for()</code> is called <code>_schem<strong>e</strong></code>,
            not <code>_schem<strong>a</strong></code>.
            Since <code>_schema</code> is not a recognized paramater for <code>flask.url_for()</code> nor for <code>index()</code>,
            it was appended to the URL as a query parameter,
            resulting in <code>submitted_request_valid()</code> rejecting all requests
            because their referrers would not begin with <code>http://tools.wmflabs.org/<var>tool-name</var>/?_schema=https</code>.
            To make POSTs work, I had to <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/cookiecutter-toolforge/commit/6500426f479074a8426c665cdd176da0d721eb07">fix the <code>full_url()</code> function</a> in the template.
            (I hope no one created a new tool between the bug being introduced and fixed in the template,
            otherwise that tool would have to be fixed as well.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When trying to make the API request to mark an edit as patrolled,
            I originally tried to use a regular MediaWiki API CSRF token as the <code>token</code> parameter for <code>action='patrol'</code>.
            However, that action requires a <code>patrol</code>-type token.
            (Likewike, there is a dedicated token type for rollback.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When I started adding the handler for the “rollback” button,
            I envisioned it as rolling back the specified revision,
            just like the “patrol” handler.
            But that’s just not how rollback works:
            you don’t rollback a revision, you rollback all edits by a user on a page.
            So I had to write some more code to query for the page ID and user name of that revision,
            and then submit that to the rollback API.
            If the request failed – for example, because someone else had edited the page after our user –
            I was going to cop out and tell the user to please resolve the situation manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it turned out that the MediaWiki API would not let me rollback edits,
            instead throwing a “permission denied” error:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            mwapi.errors.APIError: permissiondenied: The action you have requested is limited to users in one of the groups: *, [[Wikidata:Users|Users]].
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This greatly confused me at the time:
            my OAuth consumer had the “rollback” grant, I was a rollbacker,
            and neither “*” (any?) nor “users” are generally allowed to rollback edits
            (that’s restricted to rollbackers and even more privileged groups).
            I <a href="https://discourse-mediawiki.wmflabs.org/t/permissiondenied-on-rollback-api/1005">asked for help on the Wikimedia Developer Support forum</a>,
            but we were unable to figure out a solution or workaround before the presentation.
            Since rollback support wasn’t critical to me
            (depending on the time of day, it can take a bit to find edits that should be rolled back anyways, to test the feature),
            I took this as a ready-made excuse to just not implement rollback support during the presentation
            (not even the version that would throw the MediaWiki error),
            which gave me about five extra minutes of time.
            It turned out I didn’t need that extra time, but I wasn’t sure about that until the presentation was done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterwards, Gergő Tisza figured out what was wrong:
            rollback requires both edit and rollback rights, and I didn’t request edit rights for my consumer.
            This is now being discussed in <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T212851">T212851</a>;
            for the time being, I haven’t implemented rollback support in the tool yet.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Despite my practice, some things went wrong during the presentation as well.
        You can watch those in the recording, of course, but I might as well list them here, too:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When I started to write the tool,
            the Toolforge API reported that the “speedpatrolling” tool name was not available for a new tool.
            I think this must have been a temporary hiccup,
            since no such tool existed at the time,
            the same error was also reported for other tool names,
            and I was later able to create the tool under that name without a problem.
            However, to proceed during the presentation,
            I eventually had to disable the hook in the cookiecutter-toolforge template
            which usually checks if a name is available before proceeding with the template,
            by moving its file in my local copy of the template.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, this confusion also led me to call the tool “speed-patrolling” instead of “speedpatrolling” during the presentation,
            even though that name didn’t work either;
            after the presentation, I had to do some cleanup to create the “speedpatrolling” tool,
            update all references in the source code,

            Although this presentation and tool are private projects,
            and I worked on them using my private accounts,
            I did this on my work laptop,
            because it was easier to practice it there
            (and also, I guess, because my private laptop needs an adapter to emit HDMI).
            However, this meant that when I was SSHing into Toolforge,
            I was using my work account instead of my private account,
            so I couldn’t deploy the tool, to which only my private account had access.
            To fix this, I had to SSH into my home PC
            (I’m <em>very</em> glad I left it running over the holidays
            <small>(and yes, my electricity plan is green, why do you ask)</small>)
            so I could SSH from there into Toolforge, using my private account.
            (Note that this is not the same as tunneling my SSH traffic through that PC (<code>ssh -J host</code>),
            in which case I would still authenticate against Toolforge using my work credentials.)
          </p>
          <aside>
            This means that in the recording, you can see which hostname I use to refer to my home PC.
            I’ve been meaning to write a blog post about my machine names for a while now…
            <del>I’ll do it eventually™</del>

        And there we go!
        I hope this makes me seem less like, I don’t know, some kind of wizard?
        It’s completely normal to run into problems while building a tool
        (or doing any kind of software development, I suppose) –
        what matters is that you can find ways overcome those problems
        (including but not limited to solving them),
        and get help when you need it.
        Try it out, it’s a lot of fun!
