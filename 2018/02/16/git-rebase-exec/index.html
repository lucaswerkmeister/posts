      <p>
        Today at work, I was working on two long-ish chains of patches.
        They’re split up into several commits,
        but those commits were frequently moved around and reorganized while I was working on them.
        I usually only run the tests on the last commit in a chain,
        and rely on CI to tell me if any of the intermediate commits is bad
        (for instance, one commit might rely on something added in a later commit).
        However, this time, I wanted to try running the tests locally,
        and catch any errors before pushing to Gerrit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I could have done that by manually checking out each commit in the chain.
        Or I could have done a <kbd>git rebase --interactive</kbd>,
        replaced each <samp>pick</samp> with <kbd>edit</kbd>,
        and ran the tests each time Git dropped me back into the shell
        before running <kbd>git rebase --continue</kbd>.
        However, I decided to try out an option for <kbd>git rebase</kbd>
        which I had found in the manual a while ago: <strong><kbd>--exec</kbd></strong>.
        Its use is fairly simple:
      </p>
      <pre><code>git rebase --exec '<code class="language-shell">
    # this doesn’t work, please see the correction post!
    cd ../.. &&
    php tests/phpunit/phpunit.php \
        extensions/WikibaseQualityConstraints/tests/phpunit/
</code>' master</code></pre>
      <p>
        The argument to <kbd>--exec</kbd> is a shell command
        (<code>/bin/sh</code> – warning: not necessarily Bash),
        which is executed after each commit.
        If the command exits nonzero, the rebase pauses and returns to your shell,
        where you can <kbd>--continue</kbd>, <kbd>--abort</kbd> etc. it like in a normal interactive rebase.
        In my case, the tests failed on one commit
        (I had written two test cases which depended on a later commit),
        so I added two lines to temporarily skip those tests,
        amended the commit to add those two lines
        (and briefly mention them in the commit message),
        edited the rebase’s to-do list (<kbd>git rebase --edit-todo</kbd>) to <kbd>edit</kbd> the later commit,
        and <kbd>--continue</kbd>d the rebase.
        When the later commit was reached,
        I amended it to remove the skipping lines again
        and then finished the rebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that’s the story of my <em>first</em> <kbd>git rebase --exec</kbd>…
        but I said I was working on <em>two</em> chains, and as it happens,
        I found another use for <kbd>git rebase --exec</kbd> in the second chain.
        This time, I was less worried about test failures between the commits
        (they were more clearly separated – several “prepare for change” commits and then one “do the change” commit),
        but more worried about our automatic code style sniffer.
        It has a companion program to automatically fix most code style violations,
        but on a chain of commits it can still be annoying to find the right commit which needs to be fixed.
        So I used the following command:
      </p>
      <pre><code>git rebase --exec '<code class="language-shell">
    # this doesn’t work, please see the correction post!
    composer fix
    GIT_PAGER=cat git diff
    if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
        read -p "ok? " -r ok
        if [ "$ok" = ok ]; then
            git commit --all --amend --no-edit
        fi
    fi
</code>' master</code></pre>
      <p>
        This is slightly more involved than the first command above
        (the <code>diff-index</code> part is copied from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3879077/1420237">this StackOverflow answer</a>,
        and I’ll admit that the command wasn’t as nicely formatted
        when I hacked it together in my shell),
        but what it does is fairly simple –
        run <code>composer fix</code> after each commit (fix code style violations),
        show me the diff,
        and if the diff is non-empty, commit the changes
        (after a confirmation prompt, just in case something went wrong).
        This took a while to run in the background
        (the fixer is annoyingly slow),
        but apart from that it worked flawlessly.
        After that, the chain was ready to push.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that’s the story of my first two <kbd>git rebase --exec</kbd>s!
        I like this option – I think I’ll find more uses for it in the future.
        And perhaps you’ll find it useful as well!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and if you actually want to see all these commits I’m talking about
        (not that they’re very interesting) –
        the first chain starts with <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/411235/1/">change I95e2235eef</a>,
        and the second one with <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/411303/1/">change I64dc0a3200</a>.
        One of the many nice things about working on free software is being able to post those links without any problems ☺
