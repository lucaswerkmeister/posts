        Inspired by Diomedis Spinellis’ <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20170810/index.html">not so recent blog post</a>,
        I wanted to share how I (currently) manage my terminals.
        The key component is <code>tmux</code>,
        plus a useful little function of my own devising which you might find useful as well.
        (Source code is at the bottom.)
      </p>
      <p>
        My first boost in terminal use effectiveness came when I started to use <code>tmux</code> (terminal multiplexer) for all my local terminals, with no exceptions:
        previously I’d sometimes fire up <code>tmux</code> when I thought that I was embarking on some task where I would want a terminal multiplexer,
        but more often than not I found myself knee deep into a task already by the time I’d realize that it would be great to be in a <code>tmux</code> session right now –
        so one day, I configured GNOME Terminal to use <code>tmux</code> as command instead of running my shell directly,
        and I haven’t looked back since.
        Soon after, I stopped using GNOME Terminal’s native tabs in favor of <code>tmux</code> windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second, much more significant boost came from the realization
        that the default directory for new windows and panes in a <code>tmux</code> session isn’t necessarily your home directory –
        it’s a property of each session,
        by default the working directory of the initial process creating the session (for new sessions launched by GNOME Terminal, <var>$HOME</var>)
        but configurable with <kbd>tmux new-session -c DIRECTORY</kbd>.
        And if I’m working in some Git repository,
        setting the start directory of my <code>tmux</code> session to that repository makes creating new windows and panes significantly less painful,
        since they immediately start out in the right directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate this, I created a shell function which could launch a new <code>tmux</code> session
        in a certain directory in a new terminal window, to be used like this:
      </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">lterm formatter ~/git/ceylon/ceylon.formatter</code></pre>
      <p>
        And I quickly realized that I usually needed the same directories fairly often,
        so I added the capability to read the location from symlinks in <code>~/.config/lterm/</code>
        (respecting XDG variables and falling back to <code>/etc</code> and all that, of course):
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">lterm formatter
lterm ceylon
lterm systemd
lterm mw # MediaWiki
lterm wbqc # Wikibase Quality constraints</code></pre>
      <p>
        With this setup, it’s extremely painless to just launch a quick auxiliary shell for a command
        when your main shell is currently occupied by a <code>less</code>, <code>emacs</code>, etc.,
        since any new window in the session will start out in the right directory automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, however, I started using so many terminal windows that I felt myself almost drowning in them,
        and just navigating to the right one could be a nuisance.
        GNOME’s <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Key above Tab</kbd></kbd>
        (e. g. <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd></kbd> on US keyboards or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>^</kbd></kbd> on German keyboards)
        shortcut helped with this:
        it cycles between all the windows of the same application
        (while <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> cycles between different applications),
        so I could use that shortcut to switch between the most recent terminals,
        no matter how many other windows (Firefox, IDE, etc.) were also opened in between.
        However, I eventually added another feature to <code>lterm</code> to solve this problem properly:
      </p>
      <p>
        If a certain <code>tmux</code> session already existed, <code>lterm</code> would fail to create it –
        but what if instead it switched to that window?
        Fortunately, my <code>tmux</code> was already set up to set the GNOME Terminal window title according to the <code>tmux</code> session name inside it
        (e. g. <samp>systemd:1:bash - "hostname"</samp> – session name, window number, window name (usually process), and hostname),
        so I could just activate the window with a title matching the expected session name from <code>lterm</code> and be set.
        I implemented that using <code>xdotool</code>
        (and then later had to reimplement it using GNOME Shell’s dbus / JavaScript bindings due to <code>xdotool</code> not working in Wayland sessions),
        and now I could bring up any terminal using <kbd>lterm foo</kbd>, regardless of whether that terminal had already been running or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        2022-04-23 edit: The reimplementation based on <code>org.gnome.Shell.Eval</code> eventually broke,
        so I created a custom GNOME Shell extension, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5021/activate-window-by-title/">Activate Window By Title</a>
        (<a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/activate-window-by-title">source code</a>),
        to offer a custom D-Bus interface for just this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a minor bonus, <code>lterm</code> exits if it’s the first command in an interactive shell –
        so if you start a new terminal window using <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd> only to launch a “real” terminal with <code>lterm</code>,
        then the temporary terminal window will quietly close itself behind your back automatically,
        since you don’t need it anymore.
        Another bonus: <code>lterm</code> has automatic completion for all pre-configured locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want this functionality for yourself, feel free to copy the source code from my GitHub home repository:
        the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/master/.bashrc.d/lterm">lterm</a> function itself
        and the underlying <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/master/.bashrc.d/term">term</a> function it uses
        (which you might want to tweak if you prefer a different terminal emulator, like Konsole ☺).
        There is also a similar <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/master/.bashrc.d/rterm">rterm</a> function for remote terminals.
        Place those functions somewhere in your shell initialization files,
        and make sure the <code>set-titles</code> option is enabled in your <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/5d3f9be03afd27c46cf24c6dad1630e084a7f84e/.tmux.conf#L37">tmux.conf</a>,
        and everything should work!
        (2022-04-23 edit: you’ll also want to copy <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/home/blob/master/.bashrc.d/activate-window">activate-window</a>,
        and install <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5021/activate-window-by-title/">Activate Window By Title</a>.)
